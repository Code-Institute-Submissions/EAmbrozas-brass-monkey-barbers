### Design
</div>
<br>
<ul>
    <li id="typography">Typography
    <ul>
        <li>Roboto Serif font is used on all text elements throughout the page complimenting well with a classic design look of the website. Serif is used as a fallback font if for any reason the main font would not load.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="color">Colour Scheme
    <ul>
        <li>The two main colours used are whitesmoke and black to give the website a simple, classic look and also giving the highest contrast possible between the background color and text making it easier to read the information provided on the website.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="imagery"> Imagery
    <ul>
        <li>Imagery is important. All images in each section of the website are designed to be striking, catch the user's attention and help break up the text on the site improving user experience. Images have been taken for this project at Brass Monkey Barbers. Each image is edited in Adobe Lightroom to give them an older classic look and resized in Adobe Photoshop for a specific section.</li>
