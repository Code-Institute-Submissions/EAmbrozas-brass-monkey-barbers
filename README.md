### Design
<br>

#### Typography
Roboto Serif font was used on all text elements throughout the page for consistency and complimented well with a classic design look of the website. Serif font was used as a backup if for any reason the main font would not load.
<br>
<br>

#### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used were whitesmoke and black to give the website a simple, classic look and also giving the highest contrast possible between the background color and text making it easier to read the information provided on the website.
<br>
<br>

#### Imagery
Most images were made by my self for Brass Monkey Barbers
